Actual setup is pretty simple:

- Editor: Neovim for almost everything; Zed for LLM support and occasional complex codebases. Thinking about switching to Vim to avoid breaking changes? I don't know. 
- Fzf + ripgrep for searching
- Zoxide for navigation
- Tmux for terminal multiplexing (c-B + c / c-B + p, :new, what else do we need?)
- Terminal: Ghostty (Love it) on macOS and xfce4-terminal on Linux.
- Shell: zsh for now. 
- Small scripts for convenience.

Everything must be stupidly simple. I avoid using plugins and autocomplete and abstract tools as much as possible.
